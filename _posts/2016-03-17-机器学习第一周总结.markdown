###什么是 Machine Learning

目前而言，`Maching Learning` 有两种定义。   
Arthur Samuel 的定义年代比较早，也不是非常正式：`the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.`    

Tom Mitchell 的则符合现代的定义：`A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.`    

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers.    
T = the task of playing checkers.    
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
